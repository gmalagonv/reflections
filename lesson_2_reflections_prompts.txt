**What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
git starts tracking any file that is in the directory. We need to do it to tell git
that it has to start tracking them.

**How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
 What value do you think it offers?
 staging area is an intermediate between the working directory and a repository.
 it offers more control.

 **How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
 objects in staging area can be compared with the working directory (git diff) and with
 the last commit (git diff --staged). By this, we will only commit once we're sure
 that it is a logical change.

**What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history
organized? How would branches help?
Branches can be helpful when:
-experimental and probably risky changes in the code are tested.
-new versions of the code while I want to keep the original version. This new
version will evolve but itself.
