**When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  When there are several contributors to the same project.

**Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
  automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
  Given that the repositories in the remote are mainly for sharing and
  collaborating, it may happen that what you commit because it is a logical change
  for you, it is not a logical change in the spirit of the whole project that you
  are working in.
