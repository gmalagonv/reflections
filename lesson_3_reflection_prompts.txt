**When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When there are several contributors to the same project.

**Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
  automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Given that the repositories in the remote are mainly for sharing and
collaborating, it may happen that what you commit because it is a logical change
for you, it is not a logical change in the spirit of the whole project that you
are working in.

 **Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.
   When would you use one instead of another?
fork: used when you want to copy a repositry from a GitHub account to another
GitHub account.
clone: when you copy a repository from GitHub to a local machine.
branch: it is a bifurcation crated in a repository in a local machine.
